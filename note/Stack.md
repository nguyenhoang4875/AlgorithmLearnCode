Monotonic Stack

Link: https://liuzhenglaichn.gitbook.io/algorithm/monotonic-stack 
A monotonic stack is a stack whose elements are monotonically increasing or descreasing.
For a mono-decreasing stack:
    - we need to pop smaller elements before pushing.
    - it keep tightening the result as lexigraphically greater as posible. (Because we keep popping smaller elements out and keep greater elements).
